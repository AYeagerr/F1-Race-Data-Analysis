## ðŸš€ About the Project
This project is a collaborative data analysis of Formula 1. As a team, we will analyze historical race outcomes, driver and team performance, and key in-race events like pit stops and qualifying results. Our goal is to transform raw data into a clear, visual story that highlights the key trends and insights of the sport.
